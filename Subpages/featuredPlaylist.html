                description: "Lo Aayi Barsaat by Darshan Raval is a sad song about a man who is heartbroken after his lover has left him. The song is set during the monsoon season, which is a time of great change and upheaval in India. The singer compares the monsoon to his own heartbreak, saying that they are both destructive forces that can leave people feeling lost and alone.  The song begins with the singer asking anyone who finds someone who loves them the way he loved his lover to let him know. He knows that he will never find someone who loves him as much as she did, and he is resigned to a life of loneliness. The singer says that he is trying to move on with his life, but he is finding it difficult. He still thinks about her all the time, and he can't help but feel sad when he sees the rain. The singer says that the rain can wash away everything in its path, including love. He compares his heartbreak to the monsoon, saying that it has left him feeling lost and alone. He knows that he will never be the same person after she left him, and he is not sure how he will ever move on.",
